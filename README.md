# Image-Classification

Development of the ML model for image classification which then converts the model into the TF-Lite file format which can be embed on Android and iOS.
In addition, this is also a submission to complete the Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning class at Dicoding.

- The dataset has 10 000 images.
- The dataset is divided into 80% train set and 20% test set.
- The model uses a sequential model.
- Model using Conv2D Maxpooling Layer.
- Accuracy in training and validation set is 90%.
- Using Callbacks.
- Plot the accuracy and loss model.
- Writes code to save the model in TF-Lite format.
